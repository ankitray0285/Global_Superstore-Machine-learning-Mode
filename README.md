# Global_Superstore-Machine-learning-Mode
Data Analysis and Visualization Project

Overview

This project focuses on data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling using Python. It involves cleaning and transforming data, generating insightful visualizations, and implementing machine learning models to predict sales.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, type conversion, and data aggregation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends using bar charts, scatter plots, and geographic maps.

Time Series Analysis: Monthly and yearly sales trends.

Segment and Category Analysis: Evaluating the impact of different segments and categories on sales and profit.

Machine Learning Models: Predicting sales using regression models and evaluating model performance.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Plotly

Scikit-learn

Dash (for interactive visualization)

Data Processing Steps

Loading Data: Import data and handle missing values.

Type Conversion: Convert data types for efficient storage and computation.

Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful insights from date-based columns.

Data Aggregation: Grouping data based on different parameters.

Visualizations

Sales Trends: Line and bar charts for monthly/yearly sales analysis.

Profit Analysis: Scatter plots for understanding the correlation between sales and profit.

Geographic Analysis: Mapping profit across different countries.

Category Analysis: Exploring sales and profit distribution across product categories.

Machine Learning Implementation

Train-Test Split: Dividing data for model training and validation.

Linear Regression Models: Predicting sales using multiple regression techniques.

Model Evaluation: Comparing performance using RÂ², MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

How to Run the Project

Install dependencies using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn

Run the data analysis script:

python data_analysis.py

Generate and visualize results interactively using Dash or Jupyter Notebook.
